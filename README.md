Just a Simple Video Game I made for a school assignment. You just go through a level and fight or skip all the enemies
and defeat the final boss at the end of the level. It only has one level tho since that's all I could manage in a week.

## How To Play
1. Start up exe and press the start button upon the game loading.
2. You can change keybinds by clicking the gear on the top right corner of start menu.
3. Objective is to run through the level and fight the final boss who is the leader of the shadows.

## Known Bugs
1. Upon beating the boss the game over screen will not appear and you will have to leave game manually by quitting.
2. Upon dying the game over screen will not appear as well and you will again have to manually quit game.
3. Jumping may cause running animation to continue instead of jumping animation even though character is not touching ground.
